1) Promt user for input
    * use get_int to ask for an int as input
    * if input is invalid, re-promt user for another input
        * Use a do/while loop!
        * Use a do while loop vs. just a while loop because you want to prompt the user at least once and if it is invalid, you will prompt the user again
        * The integer has to be a positive number between 1-8
          * Boolean expression:
          * x < 1 || x > 8

2) Build left aligned pyramid
    * Use a for loop
      1) Print hashes #
      2) Print a new line up until the entire height of that pyramid

3) Build right aligned pyramid with dots and hashes (. #)
    * Use a for loop
      1) Print dots
      2) Print hashes
      3) Print a new line
How many dots and how many hashes?
  Depends on:
  * Height of pyramid
  * Row number

4) Build right aligned pyramid with no dots, only hashes
